## Nats http proxy

If you have existing rest apis but want to switch over to nats you will love this project!
This will go through your http routes and create nats subscriptions for each of them, adding the ability for them to be easily requested by all clients connected to your nats server.

To see how it easy it is to make your existing REST apis available on nats just take a look at the small test file.
